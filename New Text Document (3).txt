1. 1 learnt how pycharm works.(basics)
    PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains.[6] It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems (VCSes), and supports web development with Django as well as Data Science with Anaconda.

2.I learnt about ngrok.
ngrok is a cross-platform application that enables developers to expose a local development server to the Internet with minimal effort. The software makes your locally-hosted web server appear to be hosted on a subdomain of ngrok.com, meaning that no public IP or domain name on the local machine is needed. Similar functionality can be achieved with Reverse SSH Tunneling, but this requires more setup as well as hosting of your own remote server.

4.I learnt about webhooks.
A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application. The term "webhook" was coined by Jeff Lindsay in 2007 from the computer programming term hook.[1]

The format is usually JSON. The request is done as an HTTP POST request.

5.I learnt what is twilio

6 I learnt about how to use python virtual environment

   A Virtual Environment, put simply, is an isolated working copy of Python which
allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects

It enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project.


 
It doesnâ€™t actually install separate copies of Python, but it does provide a
clever way to keep different project environments isolated.
